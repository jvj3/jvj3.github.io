# Introduction

For our project, we decided to research the effectiveness of Government COVID-19 policies throughout the pandemic. There were several motivations for wanting to look into this topic. First and foremost, this topic was presented to us by Manhattan College for the annual Business Analytics Competition that they host. For this competition we were tasked with looking into different data sets provided to us by Bloomberg and Oxford, and drawing conclusions from these datasets. The guiding questions that we were presented with are as follows:

- What have we learned about facing the effects of a pandemic, globally?

- Are we better prepared for the next health crisis?

- What data did the Bloomberg and Oxford studies use? How can we characterize resposnes? What is the range of resposnes across countries? Based on our analysis what advice can we give our colleagues in other countries?

Not only were these topic interesting to us... we were also enticed by the chance at winning a cash prize if we placed top 3 in the final round of the competition. While we fell a little short of this goal, we still qualified for the final round, and placed 9th out of 34 teams competing.

Another motivation to look into this topic was how COVID-19 has greatly effected my personal life, and my partners personal life, as we are both students and athletes here at SUNY Geneseo. COVID-19 and the policies presented to us by the government have been a road bump in our busy college careers for about 2 years now, so looking into the best ways to approach a pandemic such as COVID-19 was immediately interesting to both of us. With that being said, part of the motivation to research this topic was to hopefully uncover indicators of successful practices regarding containing the spread of virus, minimizing the fatality of the virus, all while minimizing social and economic impacts. While there is no indication that a pandemic such as COVID-19 will hit again in the near future, it is best to at least begin to look into how we can contain such a catasrophe. There was no indication that COVID-19 would be so harmful, indicating that something like this could happen any day with no prior indication.

We approached the data provided to us in a couple of different ways in order to best model and draw conclusions from the data.
